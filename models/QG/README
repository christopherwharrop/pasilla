This distribution contains code to integrate the spectral quasi-geostrophic
model on the sphere of Marshal and Molteni (1983) at resolution
T21, T42, T63 or T106

All binary files are big_endian

see scripts/runqgmodel.sc how to compile, configure and run the model

./scripts: contains scripts that compile and execute the model and produce plots of
       the output and auxiliary scripts to produce inputfiles
			 
./scripts/runqgmodel.sc: compiles and runs the model at a specified resolution with standard
                     parameter values and forcing calculated from observations			 
./scripts/qgcoef.sc    : produces legendre function inputfiles for the qg model 			 
./scripts/genoro.sc    : produces orography and land-sea mask inputfile for the qg model		 
./scripts/genobs.sc    : produces a file with observed streamfunction values from relative
                 vorticity obtained from ERA interim		 
			 
			 
./inputdata: contains inputdata for the model

./inputdata/qgcoefT??.dat   : file with legendre functions on the grid
./inputdata/qgbergT??.dat   : file with topography on the grid
./inputdata/qgpvforT??.dat  : file potential vorticity forcing 
./inputdata/qgstartT??.dat  : file with initial state for streamfunction
./inputdata/sf7910T106.shfs : file with observed daily streamfunction data in 
                              spherical harmonics

./outputdata: the output of model integrations are placed in subdirectory $expid

./src : contains comqg.h with declarations and qgmodel.F and nag.f with subroutines

./rundir : temporary run directories are created here
