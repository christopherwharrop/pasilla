My attempt to 'Frankenstein' the two codes together failed. Too many instances of one
set of routines using the same variables as the other. Lots of COMMON blocks really 
made a mess of things.

New plan: create 3 new files, sort of from the ground up. They are:
util
tang
adjo

util is complete - all the 'utility' routines are there, with IMPLICIT NONE, and then the 
variables defined as they should be

tang is next - I shall need to get in all the routines that TANG uses, and revamp them to
be consistent with the existing code

adjo is last - same as above, but for the ADJOINT
